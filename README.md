# python_pdf_search
This Python script scans PDF files in a selected folder (and subfolders) for user-defined keywords, extracts surrounding context lines, and saves results to Excel. It includes a simple GUI for input, uses PyMuPDF for text extraction, supports multiprocessing for speed, and highlights matches in the terminal. Ideal for analyzing large PDF sets.
